## Batch metadata creation and bagging for Preservation AIPs
This repository includes a Python script and documentation created in the UW Libraries Preservation department in Spring 2022 for batch metadata creation and bagging AIPs. 

The original use case was a large set of working files from the creation of the UW CONTENTdm [Music Library Digital Scores Collection](https://content.lib.washington.edu/mmweb/index.html). These were grouped into three batches, each of which contained dozens of subfolders named by call number. Each of these subfolders represented an individually-cataloged physical item that needed to be packaged with appropriate metadata for preservation ingest. The CONTENTdm collection had been cataloged at the collection level, and _some_ of the individual digitized scores had been cataloged as digital resources.

The script `create_metadata.py` takes `input.csv` (template provided in this repository) and, for each row of the file, creates a metadata folder with a `readme.txt` and a `metadata.csv` file. The `metadata.csv` is generated by creating an xml template and running the [Saxon script](https://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation9.4/about/) as a subprocess, then removing the xml template. The Saxon script must be available in a separate directory at the same level (e.g. I had both "MetadataScript" and "SaxonHE9-8-0-1J" on the Desktop).
